    subtitle: "What is easy for me is not easy for everyone else, but what is simple should be simple for everyone. People spend time reading code more than the time it took for them to write it. It is too easy for us to write code that machines can understand, however productivity is related to how much code we write that is human readable. At ThoughtWorks we spend a lot of time to make the code look simple so that any one can join and contribute without much context transfer. Join us for a series of sessions where we get to write clean code.<br/>The first session would be a hands on exercise on TDD (Test driven development). There is no better way to understand a concept like TDD than getting your hands dirty. We will start off with a small presentation about TDD and how it helps. This will immediately be followed by a hands on exercise where we would attack a problem and solve it using TDD.<br/>Bring your laptops people! Ensure you have your favourite IDE installed and for this exercise you can choose to code in any language you wish.<br/>Having a test framework set up would help immensely. For example, for Java have a project set up with Junit; for node, jest or mocha."
