    title: "<a href='#'>Apache Spark Workshop</a>"
    subtitle: "<short> Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. <br/>
    It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming. <br/>
    In this workshop, we will help you to understand high level concepts and architecture of Spark. We will write & submit a simple application to the Cluster and understand some of the basics of working with a distributed system. <br/>
