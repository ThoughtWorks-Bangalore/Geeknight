    title: "<a href='#'>How Hackers Hack</a>"
    subtitle: "<short> This talk is to give you an introduction on how attackers attack servers, websites and go from there. We will look at the some of the ways they misuse open sources of intelligence and what we can do about it. We will also delve a bit into what is trust in the online world and how it manifests for defenders and attackers both. There is a disconnect between how we think about defences and how attackers think about attacking sites and servers. This talk and session aims to
    bridge that gap. We will try and cover all of this in a fun and engaging manner so that regardless of how well versed you are with security, you will get some good insights about this topic and a better idea about how hackers hack. />"
