    subtitle: "<short> Web apps gave us the power to push new features, fix bugs, and have it accessible to all our users in an instant. <br/>
    With the dawn of the native app, this flexibility was soon lost. We had to, at times wait for weeks on end, before we can have our apps approved and then made available to our customers.<br/>
    Worse still, not a lot of our customers do not prefer to download updates.. Mobile apps created a fragmented customer base, each with different versions of our application. <br/>
    There have been multiple attempts at this problem, and I would like to walk you through one such attempt, that we employ at Myntra, and which has proven successful for us so far <br /><short>"

    subtitle: "<short> It's been a decade since mobile development has started. It all started with developing apps natively. <br />
    Soon people started exploring of ways to reduce the cost/time required to build same thing across all platforms. Write-once and run-everywhere trend started with PhoneGap/Cordova/Ionic. <br/>
    It didn't take long for enterprises to realise that it was the wrong move. Lately Learn-once and write-everywhere trend started with Xamarin and React-Native. Once again there is a ray of hope to reduce the cost/time for mobile apps development. <br/>
    So let's discuss  <br />

    * Is react-native worth all the hype?  <br/>
    * How does react-native tries to solve the problem? How much code can be shared? <br/>
    * Heard of Calatrava framework?  <br/>
    * How AppHub and CodePush bring web deployment practices to native apps? <br/>
    * What are the effects of Progressive web apps on native development?  <br/> <short>"
